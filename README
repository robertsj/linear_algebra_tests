This project studies BLAS implementations of matrix-matrix and matrix-vector
operations.  The goal is to provide useful feedback on the maximum floating
point operations a system can perform.  Used in conjunction with a 
memory bandwidth test, computational bottlenecks can be found.

The Makefile is setup for my system.  Adjust as necessary for your own
vendor BLAS implementations and compilers.
