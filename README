This project studies BLAS implementations of matrix-matrix and matrix-vector
operations.  The goal is to provide useful feedback on the maximum floating
point operations a system can perform.  Used in conjunction with a 
memory bandwidth test, computational bottlenecks can be found.

The Makefile is setup for my system.  Adjust as necessary for your own
vendor BLAS implementations and compilers.

By the way, others have already put together similar (and probably
more robust) test sets.  One is the BLAS Benchmark, part of LLCBench:

I found roughly the same results using that and mine.  I did mine
mostly to ensure I knew what I was doing.
